Netflix UI Clone for Beginners
Description
This project is a simple clone of the Netflix landing page UI, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed for beginners to practice frontend development skills, focusing on creating a responsive layout that mimics Netflix's homepage, including a hero section, feature highlights, FAQ, and footer. The project features a dark theme, background overlays, and basic interactivity (if JavaScript is implemented for elements like FAQ accordions).
Note: Based on the analysis, JavaScript appears to be minimal or inline (e.g., for potential dynamic elements), but no separate JS file was identified. The focus is primarily on HTML structure and CSS styling.
Features

Hero Section: Full-screen background image with overlay, navigation bar, logo, sign-in form, and call-to-action buttons.
Feature Sections: Highlights like "Enjoy on your TV", "Download Shows Offline", "Watch Everywhere", and a kids' section, with image and video overlays.
FAQ Section: List of frequently asked questions with hover effects on boxes (potential for accordion functionality with JS).
Footer: Grid-based layout with links.
Responsive Design: Uses flexbox, grid, and media queries for adaptability across devices.
Dark Theme: Black background with red accents, mimicking Netflix's style.

Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the page content and sections.
CSS3: For styling, including flexbox, grid, absolute positioning, transitions, and imports (e.g., Google Fonts: Poppins and Martel Sans).
JavaScript: (Assumed for interactivity like button actions or FAQ toggles, though not explicitly found in separate files; may be inline or planned).
Assets: Images (e.g., bg.jpg), videos, and icons stored in the assets/ folder for backgrounds, previews, and favicons.

View the hero section with sign-in prompt.
Scroll through feature sections with descriptive text and media placeholders.
Check the FAQ for common questions.
