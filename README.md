# Netflix UI Clone for Beginners

## Description

This project is a simple clone of the Netflix landing page UI, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed specifically for beginners to practice frontend development skills. The project focuses on creating a responsive layout that closely mimics Netflix's homepage, including a hero section, feature highlights, FAQ accordion, and footer. It features a dark theme, background overlays, and basic interactivity (primarily for the FAQ section using vanilla JavaScript).

## Features

- **Hero Section**: Full-screen background image with gradient overlay, navigation bar, Netflix logo, language selector, sign-in button, and a prominent call-to-action form.
- **Feature Sections**: Multiple sections highlighting benefits like "Enjoy on your TV", "Download your shows to watch offline", "Watch everywhere", and "Create profiles for kids", with alternating image/text layouts and media elements.
- **FAQ Section**: Accordion-style frequently asked questions that expand/collapse on click using JavaScript.
- **Footer**: Comprehensive grid-based footer with useful links organized in columns.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries for seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dark Theme**: Authentic Netflix-style dark theme with red accents.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and content layout
- **CSS3** – Styling with Flexbox, Grid, custom properties, transitions, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – Vanilla JS for interactive elements (FAQ accordion toggle)
- **Google Fonts** – Poppins and Martel Sans fonts imported for typography
- **Assets** – Custom images, videos, and icons in the `assets/` folder
